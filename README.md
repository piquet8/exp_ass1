# Experimental Robotics Laboratory - Assignment 1
This project implements a simplified version of the game Cluedo where a robot moves through different rooms looking for hints to find the murderer, the weapon and the location of the crime. 
## Expected Behaviour
The robot should:
- Explore the environment by entering in different rooms
- In each room, it should look around to find hints to make hypotheses
- When a consistent hypothesis is deducible, it should go in a designed location and express it in English
- If the hypothesis is wrong, it should keep exploring and find new hints.
